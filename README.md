# Invisible-Cloak
Python Project based on OpenCV.
In this machine learning project, I have created Invisible Cloak using OpenCV. I implemented color detection and segmentation technique. In this opencv project, I learned a lot about morphological operations, masking, and other image processing concepts. This technique is opposite to the Green Screening. In green screening, we remove background but here we will remove the foreground frame. 
Algorithm:

1. Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ video.mp4 ]

Output can be seen as follows:
